prediction of active molecules.

We emphasize the classification of active molecules for
matrix metalloproteinases as protection against inflammation and use in
treatment of chronic venous diseases. The method employs a simple and novel
criterion to choose molecular descriptors and uses cross-validation to select
SVM parameters.
